Template Project
----------------

This is a C++ project template with CERN ROOT-System integration and
GNU Autotools build system.

Run "fill-in-template.sh" to fill in the template interactively, setting
the project name, author information, and so on. After fill-in-template.sh
has run through, it will automatically remove itself.

Run "build-inst-run-test.sh" to test a full build, install, run, uninstall,
maintainer-clean cycle before or after filling in the project template.
